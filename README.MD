# TattooNet

This project is an open-source app that helps you find a tattoo master in your city and country. It is built using the MERN stack, with a strong connection to a Node.js Express backend that utilizes MongoDB for data storage.

## Project Overview

The TattooNet app is currently a pet project that showcases my experience with React Native. The app allows users to search for tattoo artists in their local area and provides information such as their portfolio, ratings, and contact details.

## Getting Started

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. Install all project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   yarn
   ```

2. Create a configuration file by duplicating the `configExample.ts` file located in the `src/common` directory. Rename the duplicated file to `config.ts` and update the necessary configurations inside.

3. Run the app on iOS or Android devices using one of the following commands:

   ```
   yarn ios
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn android
   ```
